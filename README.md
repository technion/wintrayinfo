# Wintrayinfo

A modern alternative to BGInfo.

Runs as a Windows system tray icon. Displays information as a toast notification. Crucially, does not mess with Windows background.

## Motivation

In a modern world of mobile devices and external screens, BGinfo's approach means threads like this end up describing half the endpoints.

I'll add that nearly every BGInfo user has to write a VBScript to produce pretty much the same set of information as everyone else.

## A Modern Version

This app lives in the Windows systray, and can be clicked to produce a toast message of exactly what is required.
